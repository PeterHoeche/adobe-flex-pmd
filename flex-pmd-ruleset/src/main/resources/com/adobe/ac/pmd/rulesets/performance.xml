		message="Detect calls to the StyleManager that don’t pass “false” as the second parameter">
		<description>A recursive style manager call can be a very expensive operation, causing parts of the UI to flicker visibly. Instead it is preferable to defer the creation of parts of the UI that depend on a runtime CSS SWF until after the SWF has been loaded. In this case a recursive call is not required.</description>
